update_notes: "<p>This is the DSi version of NitroHax. Extract release ZIP to root\
  \ of SD card. Something with SD redirect patches like HiyaCFW required to use this\
  \ with System Menu. I do not recommend installing custom/modified SRLs to NAND.</p>\n\
  <p>Changelog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Merged improvements from Chishm's fork of NitroHax</p>\n\
  </li>\n<li>\n<p>General stability improvements to enhance the user's experience\u2122\
  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example cheats.xml is provided. It includes cheats for\
  \ a few games. For best operation only add entries for games you own. Using very\
  \ large cheat databases may still cause issues with NitroHax.</p>"
