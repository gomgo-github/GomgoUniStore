update_notes: '<p>This is a simple app that creates dummy files for hiyaCFW to work
  around the bug in the Nintendo DSi Menu that causes it to be unable to load with
  certain amounts of free space.</p>

  <p>To use simply place <code>dfc.nds</code> on your SD card, boot your DSi holding
  <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>B</kbd>, then load <code>Dummy File Creator</code> from Unlaunch''s
  file menu.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Update 2020-10-22:</h3>

  <p>With hiyaCFW v1.4.0 dummy files are now managed automatically by hiyaCFW itself,
  please simply use the latest version of hiyaCFW instead of this tool. This download
  is only being kept up for preservation purposes.</p>
