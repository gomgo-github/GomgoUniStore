update_notes: '<ul>

  <li>Added Legacy mode. This is the previous version of cart loader that doesn''t
  have TWL mode. Use this mode to boot certain flashcarts that lost compatiblity with
  2.4 version of NTR_Launcher. Note that only the TWL clock option will work with
  Legacy mode. The other advanced options do not work with Legacy mode. Legacy mode
  is skipped automatically if a TWL cart is detected as the previous bootloader doesn''t
  support TWL carts.</li>

  <li>3DS CIA file is now found inside the ZIP file instead of as separate asset on
  Github.</li>

  </ul>'

A DS Slot-1 Launcher. Original code from NitroHax but with cheat engine/menu stripped out. Useful for launching older DS flashcarts.
Credits go to Chishm for NitroHax which this source is based from and WinterMute for dslink source/reset code.
