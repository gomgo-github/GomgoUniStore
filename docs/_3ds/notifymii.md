update_notes: '<p>If everything''s working then this will be my last release for now.</p>

  <p>What''s new:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Major UI changes.</li>

  <li>Uses the 3DS''s software keyboard.</li>

  <li>Support for viewing a notification''s image.</li>

  <li>Preview support for TXT and JPG files.</li>

  <li>Installed title list will now display all title''s names alongside their title
  ID.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>What''s fixed:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Deleting a notification will no longer mess with other notifications.</li>

  <li>Max image filesize is now 50kb instead of 128kb.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>What''s next:<br>

  There are some leftovers of unimplemented stuff in this release: Nintendo 3DS Camera
  support, notification editing, multi-selection, and other stuff.<br>

  These were canceled and will be implemented into a future release, which will have
  a GUI.<br>

  However, it''ll take some time as I don''t plan on working on this anytime soon.</p>'
