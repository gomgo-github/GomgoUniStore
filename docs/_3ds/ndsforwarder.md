  <p>Requires full CFW via Rosalina (b9s+luma3ds)</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>Put in /3ds/<br>

  Open with homebrew launcher</p>

  <ul>

  <li>note: you also need the nds-bootstrap forwarder pack from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k5uaa4jzbtkgm0z/DS%20Game%20Forwarder%20pack%20%283DS%20SD%20Card%29.7z?dl=1"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

  <li>Be sure to copy the <code>_nds</code> folder from the <code>for SD card root</code>
  folder to the sd card.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>

  <li>Custom banners! They must be named the same as the nds file. If your nds file
  is <code>Jamal''s Home Cooking.nds</code> your custom banner should be <code>Jamal''s
  Home Cooking.bin</code>.  Custom banners can be located with the nds file or in
  <code>/3ds/forwarder/banners/</code></li>

  <li>Auto Random TID.  This allows separate forwarders for romhacks that dont change
  TIDs</li>

  <li>Custom Title. If you dont have a custom banner, or want one but need a different
  Title, check the box!</li>

  <li>Install all in folder. You can install forwarders for all nds files in any given
  folder</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Todo</h2>

  <ul>

  <li>Look... GUI code is a downright mess. I need to fix it.</li>

  <li>Also, mixed c and cpp files, ugh</li>

  <li>Icon?</li>

  </ul>'

To install you will need to download the [3DS SD card forwarder pack](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k5uaa4jzbtkgm0z/DS%20Game%20Forwarder%20pack%20%283DS%20SD%20Card%29.7z?dl=1), then extract the contents of the `for SD card root` folder to the root of your SD card.

When installing with Universal-Updater this is done automatically.
