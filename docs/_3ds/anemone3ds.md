update_notes: "<p>Happy Holidays everyone! We hope your holiday season has been going\
  \ well despite the interference from Covid. Here's a new release of Anemone3DS with\
  \ some minor feature updates and bugfixes as our gift to you.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n\
  <ul>\n<li>Themes without an SMDH file are now supported again!</li>\n<li>If you\
  \ install a theme without BGM, and then do a BGM-only install, the BGM flag will\
  \ be automatically set to ensure your music plays properly.</li>\n<li>You can now\
  \ dump themes! Upon selecting the dump theme option in the extra menu, you'll be\
  \ able to enter a name, and the theme body_LZ.bin and bgm.bcstm will be stored in\
  \ the folder /themes/, along with a dummy SMDH file, meaning the theme will be immediately\
  \ usable in Anemone. This allows you to translate CIA themes to Anemone themes and\
  \ thus manage all your themes in one place.</li>\n<li>If you scan a QR code and\
  \ the file host doesn't have a filename set for some reason, you'll now be able\
  \ to manually enter the filename you want it to be saved as.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bugfixes:</p>\n\
  <ul>\n<li>A variety of QR code bugfixes should help the QR reader be more stable\
  \ than ever<g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"tm\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2122.png\"\
  >\u2122\uFE0F</g-emoji>.</li>\n<li>Various bugfixes and refactoring in the networking\
  \ code to prevent possible crashes.</li>\n<li>Memory leak fix in theme loading code\
  \ to allow you to load even more themes!</li>\n<li>Certain previews used to have\
  \ inverted colors when loaded. This has been fixed.</li>\n<li>ThemePlaza url has\
  \ been updated to the new one. While this wasn't a problem yet, as the old domain\
  \ redirects to the new domain, it will prevent issues in the future.</li>\n<li>Various\
  \ other null dereferences cleaned up to prevent crashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a personal\
  \ note from me:</p>\n<p>It's always fun to get to work on the application and it's\
  \ fantastic to see the continued support from the community. While this isn't the\
  \ rewrite I promised in the last release, I still plan on doing it at some point.\
  \ For now, I care more about creating actual useful updates and getting them out\
  \ sooner rather than later. I hope to see you all again in a hopefully much better\
  \ 2021!</p>\n<p>~ astronautlevel2<br>\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\
