## App Requests
### Rules
Any app requests must conform with the following rules to be added.
1. Do not include any copyrighted content that you don't have the rights to use (piracy)
   - Loading copyrighted assets externally from the SD card is fine as long as it's not shipped with the application, whether from the script or in the app itself
1. The app should not be focused around NSFW content
   - If it does have NSFW content in it as a minor part, then it should be clearly labeled as such
1. There must be some description of what the app does, whether in the README or submitted app description
1. Must have some functionality, not just a testing app

### Recommendations
These are not strict requirements, but are recommended.
1. Make the source code be publically accessible
1. Use GitHub Releases for app downloads, this makes update tracking and downloads much easier
   - Bitbucket is also supported, but not as well, and other sites can be added if they have a good API for it
1. Have a place for public discussion of your app (GitHub Discussions, GBAtemp, Discord server, etc)
1. If a online service component exists, try to make it open source and allow the URL which the apps connects with to be changed, in case the service goes down
